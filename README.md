Fractions Class for C++

A little example of my code for CSIS137 Intro to Advanced C++.

*Note: Fractions will be simplified upon creation, but if using setNumer()
or setDenom() member functions, must use setNumer() first or else setDenom()
which does the simplification will use the default 0 for numerator in finding the 
greatest common factor.
